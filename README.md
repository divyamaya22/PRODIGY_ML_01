This project builds a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Using the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle, the model is trained to estimate property values accurately.

Key steps include data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation using Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy. This project provides a foundation for real estate price estimation and predictive analytics. ðŸš€
